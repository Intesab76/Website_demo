    A way of acting. Really, it’s a vision to do no patient harm. When we think about how documents
    like policies and procedures guide patient care, our thought process is that, by following them,
    there will be a positive outcome, eg. patient safety. But in truth, excellent care given is a reflection
    of a well-written policy or procedure.
    Healthcare policies and procedures are molded and shaped by many factors. One is
    healthcare regulations, like state and federal mandates. Another is evidence-based practices, as we
    have seen with the patient safety movement. Lastly, there are accreditation standards that impact
    the content of policies and procedures, such as those set by The Joint Commission. Creating these
    documents is an art and with any form of art, we know that the expertise doesn’t develop
    overnight. That being said, here are some key points to consider when creating the tapestries that
    guide our healthcare providers.Policies and procedures should not be written by those that are not experts on the topic.
    Consider the organization who asks their compliance officer to single-handedly write policies
    related to informed consent. Yes, there are some compliance officers with a background in
    healthcare law, who know about consent and what is required by the State or CMS; for example,
    they’ll know that only a licensed provider can obtain informed consent.Policies and procedures should not be written under the assumption that one size fits all!
    For example, a hospital may have read the requirements for the Joint Commission’s National
    Patient Safety Goal on Hand Off, and they may have decided that SBAR (Situation Background
    Assessment and Recommendations), a model that is evidenced-based and commonly used for
    physician-nurse communication, is the right one to cite in the general policy related to Hand Off in
    that hospital. However, an area of the hospital may be using a different tool that meets the intent
    of this safety goal, and precautions need to be taken to make sure that all other policies on Hand
    Off should cross- reference this department-specific policy.
    Too often, a policy committee will sit down anxiously and work on a new policy without
    first identifying any existing policies on that topic. If there is an ambulatory center or primary clinic
    under the hospital’s license, those areas are considered another “department”, and the hospital
    policy committee needs to ensure that those departments’ policies are reviewed as well. A big
    mistake is to make a generic house-wide policy on Hand Off that ignores what is being done
    elsewhere. During the survey, the surveyor will surely visit those other areas and find a completely
    different policy on Hand Off. This is when you’ll get caught for your lack of oversight. But as long as
    the generic policy acknowledges or reference the department specific policy, and there is some
    way to link them, then you avoid those “silos”.There have been policies that mimic the content from The Joint Commission’s CAMH
    (Comprehensive Accreditation Manual for Hospital) word for word. Having language from
    regulatory texts is not the problem - it shows the surveyor reading the document that the
    organization is aware of the requirement. The difficulty, however, is when the copy and paste text
    includes so much irrelevant information that it discourages the staff from reading the policy in the
    first place. It gives the staff incentive to sign off on it without reading it thoroughly. Even worse,
    there are times when staff has been instructed to carry out a procedure in a way that is
    standardized to that hospital, but the copy and pasted material utilizes a completely different
    method. When the surveyor comes, staff is asked about the policy and they state something
    different from the actual policy.
