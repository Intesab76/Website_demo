        Well it is very delightful and a proud moment that we have been with you all for quite a long time and you all have accepted our servings and henceforth encourage us to 
        keep moving at a decent pace with alacrity and zeal. It all started in the year 1999 when it is definitely a rock challenge to incept such an organization
        which doesn't have a clear-cut picture whether it is going to be prevalant or not. But as said dedication and hardwork can
        be a good duet to achieve a benchmark and hence we did. And still we are suppose to go way beyond than we are expecting to 
        and not letting our people to lag in terms of medical health care and treatment.
